This pipeline is developed by the `Satterthwaite lab at the University of Pennysilvania
<https://www.satterthwaitelab.com/>`_  and `Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaaging lab  at the University of Minnesota 
<https://innovation.umn.edu/developmental-cognition-and-neuroimaging-lab/>`_ for 
open-source software distribution.

About
------
This pipeline is a robust postprocessing pipeline for  fMRI data. It is desined to denoised the preprocessed fMRI data from 

1. `fMRIprep <https://fmriprep.org>`_
2. `NiBabies <https://nibabies.readthedocs.io>`_
3. `DCAN <https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/abcd-hcp-pipeline>`_
4. `Minimal preprocessed HCP data <https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-development/data-releases>`_


See the `documentation <https://xcp-abcd.readthedocs.io/en>`_ for more details.
